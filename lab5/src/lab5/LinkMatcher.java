	 * You are required to use a regular expression to find links 
	 * (use variable REGEX defined on top of the class - fill in the actual pattern).
	 * You are required to use classes Pattern and Matcher in this method. 
	 * Do not use any other classes or packages (except String, ArrayList, Pattern,  Matcher, BufferedReader etc.)

	 *            The name of the HTML file.
